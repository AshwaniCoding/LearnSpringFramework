------------------------------------SPRING NOTES--------------------------------------18 Jun 25

---------------------------------BASIC INSTALLATION---------------------------------

- download java >17 version and eclipse ide

-----------------------------------FIRST PROJECT-------------------------------------

- spring framework provides dependency injection and auto wiring
- terminology: tight coupling, loose coupling, IOC container, Application context, component Scan, Dependency Injection, Spring Beans, Auto wiring

- go to the website "start.spring.io" and there use the latest version of spring and don't use the snapshot version
- also use the version of java above 17 and after that click on generate
- maven: java dependency management tool
- spring initializer:  website to quickly create java project

---------------------------------RUN MARIO GAME---------------------------------------19 Jun 25

- for running the first game you should crate a class with the main method
- create object of MarioGame class and also object of GameRunner class
- also declare the MarioGame object in the game runner class and using constructor set the value
- pass the object of marioGame class inside the GameRunner object
- then create a run method inside the GameRunner class

- after that just create the up, down, left and right button in the mario game class
- after that use all the methods or actions inside the run() method

------------------------------------VAR--------------------------------------

- it is a new feature introduced in java 10
- type inference: it allows the compiler to infer the type of the variable based on the value assigned
- compiler will automatically infer the type of variable

----------------------------TIGHTLY COUPLED-----------------------------------

- suppose you create another game SuperContraGame with some actions like up, down, left and right
- and use the same game runner file to run the game
- then you have to do changes like you have to declare the object of new superContraGame
- this is called the tight coupling
- coupling: how much work is involved in changing something
- few examples: a car is tightly coupled to an engine while wheels are loosely coupled to car
- another example is you can go with laptop anywhere but you can not move computer anywhere
- basically it should not specific to only one game
- in the above case game runner is tightly coupled to only one class

- when one class is heavily dependent on another class that is called the tight coupling

--------------------------------LOOSELY COUPLED-----------------------------------

- for making it loosely coupled just use the interface GamingConsole so that you can remove the tight coupling
- just create a interface and implement on both the games
- then instead of creating an object of any specific class, create the object of interface

- as you have implemented loosely coupled so you can now add as many games as you want
- add pacman game in the console and run it using the GameRunner class

------------------------------SPRING FRAMEWORK, CONFIGURATION ANNOTATION------------------------------------
- wiring of dependencies: the process of providing one object with the necessary dependencies it needs to function, often by passing them into a constructor or method
- firstly created the App02HelloWorldSpring class and then also created the HelloWorldConfiguration with @Configuration annotation
- then just created new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext() by passing the HelloWorldConfiguration.class
- @Configuration annotation says that this class contains the beans that you want to manage using spring
- all the spring beans defined inside the configuration class
- configuration class we need to launch it so for that use the new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext()
- we want to launch a spring context with that configuration so we launch inside jvm using the main method
- we have to declare the beans inside the configuration class

--------------------------FIRST JAVA SPRING BEAN----------------------------------------------

- for that just go inside the configuration class declare a method and use the @Bean annotation
- now that method will be treated as a bean and can be managed by spring
- and you can access it by using the context like context.getBean("beanName or methodName")
- jvm >> spring >> bean
- you can name the bean also by just the name

----------------------------RECORD------------------------------------

- new feature introduced in jdk 16
- record Person (String name, int age){};
- when you are using record then you don't need to create setter getter and constructor all those things
- you can directly use it and get the data

-----------------------------------------BEANS---------------------------------------------------23 Jun 25

- you can get the bean in different ways one is by method name and other by setting the name of it
- you can also get it by the type as well like Address.class
- you can use existing beans to create new beans

-----------------------------SPRING CONTAINER, BEAN AND JAVA BEAN, POJO-----------------------------------

- spring container: it manages spring beans and their lifecycle
- there are two popular types of IOC containers: bean factory and application context

- Java bean: if a class has public no arguments constructor and has getters & setters and has implements serializable
- then instance of a class is called java bean

- anything which is managed by spring is called spring bean
- spring uses IOC container(Bean factory or application context) to manage these objects

- pojo: no constraints and any java object is pojo

-----------------------------------GET ALL BEANS--------------------------------------------24 Jun 25

- for getting all the beans list managed by the spring you can use the context.getBeanDefinitionNames()
- if you have multiple beans with the same class then it will give error
- for fixing it you will have to set one as a primary one by using @Primary annotation

- another way of autowiring is @Qualifier("qualifierName") and this will autowire the bean

-------------------------------RUN WITHOUT SEPARATE CONFIGURATION------------------------------26 Jun 25

- just copy all the beans from the configuration file and paste it in the annotation config file
- and make that file itself as a configuration file and pass the same filename in application context

-------------------------GETTING SPRING TO CREATE BEAN, @COMPONENT, @COMPONENT SCAN----------------------------------

- for getting spring to create the bean for use so we have to  declare the game class with annotation @Component
- after that just where we are using it we have to annotate it with @ComponentScan("packageName")
- package name where the component is available
- spring has created the object of pacman game and also autowired with the gaming console

- using the @component and @componentScan annotation spring is able to scan the right packages, find the components, create instances,
- autowire them for us and get the entire application up and running.
- when you give @componentScan without package name, it will scan the current package
- when you use @component then spring will manage the instance of a class

----------------------------------WHAT WE DID TILL NOW?-----------------------------------

- as all the beans, we have to declare under the @Configuration we annotated the main class as configuration
- then instead of creating the bean explicitly we used spring @component to define the bean
- and to search the bean we have used @component scan and tell the path
- this will search the component in the package you mentioned and autowire them
- if there are multiple component then it will give error
- so we have to declare one of them as @Primary
- or for running the specific one you cna use @Qualifier too

-----------------------------------@PRIMARY @QUALIFIER-------------------------------------

- @Primary: A bean should be given preference when multiple candidates are qualified
- @Qualifier: A specific bean should be autowired (name of the bean can be used as a qualifier)

- if it's okay to use any one of them then just use @Autowired
- if you want to use the specific one then use both @Autowired and @Qualifier("QualifierName")
- if you don't declare the name of the qualifier then just use the name of class with first letter small as a qualifier name

----------------------------------DEPENDENCY INJECTION TYPES--------------------------------

- Constructor Based: dependencies are set by creating the Bean using its constructor
- Setter Based: dependencies are set by calling the setter method on your beans
- Field: No setter or constructor. dependency is injected using reflection.

- if you declare the field of class inside a component and autowired it so it is defined as the field dependency injection
- if you declare the @Autowired in the setters method then it is called setter based dependency injection
- if you declare the @Autowired in the constructor then it is called the constructor based dependency injection

- when you use the constructor based injection then you don't need the @Autowired annotation
- the spring suggest to use the constructor based injection because all the initialization happened just in one method
- once the initialization is done, the bean is ready to use
- it's always recommended to use the constructor injection
